## How does this repo relate to the helm-charts repo?

The helm-charts repo has been archived. This repo has all the commit history and releases copied over from that repo and is continuing development to provide a SPIRE helm chart for the community to use and contribute to.

## How do I migrate my changeset from the old helm-charts repo to this one?

Run one of these commands to switch to the new repo:

- If working off a branch (maintainers with write access): `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:spiffe/helm-charts-hardened.git`
- If working off a fork:
    1. Create a new fork of helm-charts-hardened
    1. In your local clone of your old fork of helm-charts: `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<your new fork>/helm-charts-hardened.git`

Then just `git push` your branches. Git history has been migrated over so you can just push your existing branches without issues.

## How do I update my helm registry to point to this one?

Assuming you named the repo `spiffe`:

``` bash
helm repo remove spiffe
helm repo add spiffe https://spiffe.github.io/helm-charts-hardened
```

## Pods are stuck terminating after uninstall. How do I fix it?

If you uninstall the SPIRE chart before all users of the CSI driver are removed, Pods will get stuck in a terminating state waiting for the driver, that no longer is installed, to unmount the volumes for the Pod. In order to fix this, reinstall the chart and remove all affected workloads that are not part of the SPIRE helm chart itself, before attempting to remove SPIRE again.

You can discover Pods that use the driver with the following command:

```shell
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{$nn := printf "%s %s" .metadata.namespace .metadata.name}}{{range .spec.volumes}}{{if .csi.driver}}{{if eq .csi.driver "csi.spiffe.io"}}{{printf "%s\n" $nn}}{{end}}{{end}}{{end}}{{end}}'
```

## Uninstall is stuck. How do I fix it?

If you uninstall the SPIFFE CSI driver manually before removing the chart, Pods can still be using the driver and are unable to unmount the CSI volume.

To resolve, reinstall the chart before trying to remove it again.

## The PSAT plugin is not working

The chart requires `Projected Service Account Tokens` which has to be enabled on your Kubernetes API server. In most cases this is already done for you.

> [!Note]
> This is enabled by default with newer versions as shown by the existence of:
>
> ```yaml
>        - --service-account-issuer
>        - --service-account-key-file
>        - --service-account-signing-key-file
> ```

See [Service Account Token Volume Projection](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#serviceaccount-token-volume-projection) in the Kubernetes docs for more details.

To enable Projected Service Account Tokens on Docker for Mac/Windows run the following
command to SSH into the Docker Desktop K8s VM.

```bash
docker run -it --privileged --pid=host debian nsenter -t 1 -m -u -n -i sh
```

Then add the following to `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml`

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - command:
        - kube-apiserver
        - --api-audiences=api,spire-server
        - --service-account-issuer=api,spire-agent
        - --service-account-key-file=/run/config/pki/sa.pub
        - --service-account-signing-key-file=/run/config/pki/sa.key
```
